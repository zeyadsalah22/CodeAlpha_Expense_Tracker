# Expense Tracker

This project is a simple Expense Tracker web application. It allows users to track their expenses by adding, editing, and deleting expense items. The application stores the data in the browser's local storage, so the expenses persist even after the page is refreshed.

- **Edit Expense:** Existing expenses can be edited, allowing users to modify the category, amount, or date.
- **Delete Expense:** Users can delete individual expenses by clicking the delete button next to each expense item.
- **Delete All Expenses:** There's an option to delete all expenses at once by clicking the "Delete All Expenses" button.
- **Total Calculation:** The application calculates and displays the total amount of all expenses.
